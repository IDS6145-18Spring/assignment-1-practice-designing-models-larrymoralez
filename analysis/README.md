## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation
In order to simulate the destruction and regrowth of grass at dog parks I would do an agent based simulation using anylogic.

Anylogic is user friendly and simple to learn. What's more, its simplicity is matched by its power and can surely handle the task at hand.

Each park will have a total area, and this total area will be comrpised of an area that is made up of grass. The area that is not made up of grass is dirt and is in need of repair. As humans and dogs visit the park, the amount of grass decreases. Furthermore, the more tennis balls there are in the park, the more the dogs and humans turn up more grass, additionally increasing the amount of grass that is destroyed.

With this data the city can run simulations to predict when grass will begin being destroyed and send mainenance crews out to take cost saving preventitive measures that also keep the park clean and enjoyable for its visitors.
