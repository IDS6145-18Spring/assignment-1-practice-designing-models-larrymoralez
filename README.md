Using Smart Technology to Improve Dog Park Quality

Having a clean and healthy dog parks for city dwellers who frequent them improves the quality of life of owners and their pets.
For instance, the Lake Eola dog park near my home is frequently turned to dirt as people and dogs visit. The dogs often become filthy along with their owners, and the dust from the play is often times thrown into the air and into the eyes of visitors. This is incredibly painful, especially for children.
It does not appear that the city has an effective means to control the destruction of the grass at the park. Instead, they wait until the enough complaints are filed to send a mainenance crew to assess the issue. Large areas of the park are then roped off (which dogs don't typically obey) while it is being fixed. During this repair period the parks recieve far fewer visitors than usual, and dogs and their owners have fewer opportunities to socialize.

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

A smart city leverages technology to engender sustainable development and thereby enriches the lives of its citzens. My city currently faces an issue of chronic destructing of its dog park grass. If the city were to employ sensor technology to track the activity of the park goers and their pets, they could more accurately predict the grass destruction and implement cost saving preventitive measures rather than long and arduous repairs.

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

I have chosen to use AnyLogic to conduct an agent-based simulation of the decay and growth of dog park grass in the cities major dog parks. Additional information can be found in my [**Analysis**](https://github.com/IDS6145-18Spring/assignment-1-practice-designing-models-larrymoralez/blob/master/analysis/README.md) file in the analysis folder.
